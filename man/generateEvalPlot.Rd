\title{Internal plotting function.}
\usage{
generateEvalPlot(MedExpr, SeqDepth, Slopes, Name,
  NumExpressionGroups = 10, BeforeNorm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{MedExpr}{non-zero median expression for all genes.}

\item{SeqDepth}{sequencing depth for each cell/sample.}

\item{Slopes}{per gene estimates of the count-depth relationship.}

\item{Name}{name for plot title.}

\item{NumExpressionGroups}{the number of groups to split the data into,
genes are split into equally sized groups based on their non-zero median
expression.}

\item{BeforeNorm}{whether dat have already been normalized.}
}
\value{
a plot of the un-normalized slope densities.
}
\description{
Genes are divided into NumExpressionGroups = 10 equally sized
   groups based on their non-zero median expression. Slope densities are plot
   for each group.
